# BTI-LiDAR
---

This project was an attempt to get the Ouster-OS1 LiDAR working inside of ROS2, with the ultimate goal of implementing it onto the Aurora Robotics Break the Ice entry.

Alongside the two projects inside of the repository, others were used (and heavily modified)

#### Robot Localization for ROS2 by automaticaddison: https://github.com/automaticaddison/robot_localization
